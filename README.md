# Google Data Analytics Capstone Project
Welcome to the Cyclistic bike-share analysis case study! In this case study, I will perform real-world tasks of a junior data analyst for a fictional company, Cyclistic.

## About the company :bicyclist:
In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering. Since then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system at any time.
One approach that helped make these things possible was the flexibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who buy annual memberships are Cyclistic members.

## Business task :dart:
Cyclisticâ€™s finance analysts concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders. The marketing director, Lily Moreno, believes that maximizing the number of annual members will be critical to future growth. Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. Three questions will guide the future marketing program:

*	**How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?**
*	Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
*	How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?

The director of marketing assigned me the first question to answer.
